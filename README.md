# Tic tac toe game

## Project intro
I created the well known tic tac toe game with the library Pygame in Python.

I created this project to just practice more with Python and with the four pilars of OOP.

While I create the game I try to implement the OOP principles Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance and Encapsulation.

I also want to  make this a online multyplayer game by using network sockets.

## How to start
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

In the terminal run:
`py run.py`
